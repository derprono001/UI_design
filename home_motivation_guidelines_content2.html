      <h2>Surmount Insecurity</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Insecurities</h3>
      The first step is all about awareness. You need to identify the types of insecurities you typically struggle with. This will require uncovering irrational beliefs and unhelpful thoughts that are at the core of your insecurities.<br>
      Take a moment to ask yourself the following questions:<br>
      What exactly do I tend to feel insecure about?<br>
      What uncertainty exists that is making me feel insecure?<br>
      What worries or fears are making me feel insecure?<br>
      Why am I feeling insecure about these things?<br>
      What underlying irrational beliefs are at the core of these insecurities?<br>
      What unhelpful thinking styles are at the heart of these beliefs?<br>
      What is the root cause of all these insecurities?<br>
      This is all about peeling back the layers. The deeper you go, the better you will understand how you have come to develop these insecurities.<br>
      The root cause of your insecurities often stems from a cluster of memories you have held onto for many years. These memories influence your decisions and actions. And they are, of course, a result of past experience. However, your interpretation of those experiences is the determining factor in how you feel.<br>
      At the heart of these experiences are a set of limiting beliefs and/or unhelpful thoughts that you have chosen to adopt. You must first work through these areas to begin weeding out your insecurities.<br><br>


      <h3>Step 2: Practice Being Objective</h3>
      It’s time now to challenge your insecurities.<br>
      Your insecurities are nothing more than interpretations you have made about yourself, others, circumstances, or about what will or won’t happen. On the surface, they are just opinions and perspectives you have latched onto.<br>
      To change our perspectives we need to challenge them in some way. In other words, we need to think more rationally and objectively about our insecurities. And that can be done by asking yourself the following set of questions:<br>
      Is this really how things are or just how I imagine them to be?<br>
      How could things be different to the way I am seeing and interpreting them?<br>
      Given my predicament, are my expectations realistic in this particular situation?<br>
      How else could I view or interpret this situation?<br>
      How else could I view myself and what I believe I’m capable of in this particular situation?<br>
      What is a more realistic set of expectations I could create?<br>
      When you challenge yourself to think objectively, you start to question the validity of your experience. You throw doubt at the interpretations you have made and open the door to new possibilities and perspectives.<br><br>


      <h3>Step 3: Reflect on Your Successes</h3>
      Your next step is to take a moment to reflect on your successes and accomplishments.<br>
      Have a think about all that you have done and successfully achieved over a lifetime. Consider the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.<br>
      Take into account the strengths that served you and the process you underwent to move through difficult moments that would otherwise have held you back. Ask yourself:<br>
      What have I excelled at in the past?<br>
      Why have I excelled at these things?<br>
      What strengths have helped me to excel in these areas?<br>
      What personal attributes were of value at the time?<br>
      How could I potentially bring that mindset into this situation?<br>
      Reflecting on your successes in this way helps put things in perspective. It reminds you that you are capable of working through difficulties in optimal ways. Moreover, it gives you the confidence and self-assurance needed to get through anything. As long as you bring those same strengths, attributes, and adopt the right mindset, anything is possible.<br><br>


      <h3>Step 4: Assess Your Circumstances</h3>
      With a higher level of self-confidence at your disposal, you’re now ready to begin evaluating the nature of your circumstances.<br>
      When we feel insecure about something, we convince ourselves that things are going to be a certain way. Subsequently, we reflect on the worst case scenario, which forces us to retreat back into the safety of our comfort zone.<br>
      It’s difficult to take any form of proactive action when we’re riddled with uncertainty. What you therefore subsequently need is a little certainty.<br>
      Consider for a moment the worst case scenario and how you might potentially handle things. Consider also the best case scenario and what that might mean. And finally, reflect on the regrets that may result if you fail to overcome your insecurities. Ask yourself:<br>
      What’s the worst that could possibly happen if I take action despite my insecurities?<br>
      So what? Who cares? Things are probably not as bad as I make them out to be.<br>
      How could I potentially handle myself during this worst case scenario?<br>
      How could I possibly turn a horrible experience into an opportunity for something better?<br>
      What’s the best that could possibly happen if I take action to move beyond my insecurities?<br>
      What regrets might I have if I hold myself back and allow my insecurities to get the better of me?<br>
      The purpose of this step is to drop your guard — to let go of resistance. Moreover, it’s about exploring the possibilities and the regrets you will face if you refrain from taking action.<br><br>


      <h3>Step 5: Engage in Positive Self-Talk</h3>
      It’s time now to prime your body and brain for action. One of the best ways to do this is to involve yourself in positive self-talk. For instance, repeat the following:<br>
      I am a confident and capable person…<br>
      I believe I can do this…<br>
      I will just take one small action to get the ball rolling…<br>
      I will learn from my mistakes and keep moving forward without hesitation…<br>
      The focus words here are “without hesitation.” The longer you take to decide whether or not you will take action, the more doubts will creep into your head and the more insecure you will feel.<br>
      This is where you just need to be decisive and use the power of momentum to get the ball rolling in a small way. What I mean by this is to just do something small that helps you move forward. This ain’t about finishing the race, it’s rather about going just a little further than before. That’s all it takes to start building momentum. <br><br>


      <h3>Step 6: Make a Full Commitment</h3>
      The final step is to make a full blown commitment to overcoming your insecurities.<br>
      Making a commitment isn’t something you just do in your head. It’s rather something you adopt into your life.<br>
      To overcome your insecurities, you need to break away from old habits and patterns of behavior. You then need to replace those habits with empowering habits, daily rituals, and routines that support your goals and objectives. Moreover, you must condition a new set of beliefs that align with those habits. Only in this way will you acquire the mental strength and momentum needed to overcome your insecurities.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
