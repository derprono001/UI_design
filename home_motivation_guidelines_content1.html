		<h2>Students: 10 ways to beat stress</h2>

        <h3>1. Exercise</h3>
        Doing sport at least once a week is the best way to reduce stress. It helps your body produce endorphins, which make you feel good. Even daily walks of 30 minutes can help reduce stress levels but it's even better to work out intensively. Even if you don't feel like it at the time you will feel the benefits afterwards.
        Joining a sports club could also help with stress as the regular contact with other people should help improve your mood.
        And why not try yoga? It's a great way to ease your mind and relax your muscles.


        <h3>2. Meditation</h3>
        It might sound simple, but sitting quietly for 10 minutes a day can really help with stress levels. If you've never tried meditation before, it's worth a go.
        Good breathing techniques can put you in a more relaxed state as they send oxygen surging through your bloodstream, helping to calm you down and beat the stress.

        <h3>3. Take breaks regularly</h3>
        Short breaks between working can help you switch off. But longer breaks are important too.
        How about taking the weekend off to relax? Make time for fun and for yourself even if this means that you have to schedule time away from your work. You'll hopefully come back to your work feeling fresh.


        <h3>4. Try to see the positive side</h3>
        If you missed a deadline, try to appreciate what you learned from this mistake: now you know how to plan ahead. Things might seem bad, but if you try, there is usually something positive to be learned.


        <h3>5. Listen to music</h3>
        Listening to music can help calm you down and put you in a better frame of mind. If you're feeling stressed, putting on some calming music while you work could really help.


        <h3>6. Laugh</h3>
        They say that laughter is the best medicine, and it's really true. Laughing out loud increases oxygen and blood flow which automatically reduces stress.
        Not taking life too seriously can help everyone live a better and easier life. Make time for yourself, log out of Twitter and take breaks. It's about time that we students accept that we can achieve just as much in life without all the stress.
